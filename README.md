# TheMexicanMaraudersBot

--INTRO--
This is a Discord bot for the Roblox group "The Mexican Marauders". We are a casual sf group. 
This bot is meant to perform various tasks like avatar verification and handling fairzone reqs etc.
It is open source so feel free to contribute or use this code.


--SETUP--
The setup for this bot is very simple currently; just edit the values in config.json and thats about it. If you are planning on contributing, don't 
edit the config file. I recommend using the assumed-unchanged command in your local repo. E.g something like this: git update-index --assume-unchanged config/config.json

Thanks and if you have any questions feel free to dm me on Discord\n
